# h2 homework from Information Security ICI002AS2AE-300 course teached by Tero Karvinen
### x) Read and summarize (This subtask x does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like)
        1. OWASP: OWASP 10 2021
        - A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration
         - Overview - upranked from #6 to #5, part of the reason is the shift toward highly configurable softwares. Including CWE16 (Config.) and CWE611 (Improper Restriction of XML Extension Entity Reference)
         - Description - list of application features potentially increasing the application's vulnerability 
          - missing proper security hardening accross **any part** of the app stack of improperly configured permissions on cloud services,
                                - unnecessary featured enabled or installed (ports, pages, accounts, priviliges, etc.),
                                - default account setup enabled and unchanged, 
                                - error messages revealing too much,
                                - latest security features disabled or not configured securely,
                                - security setting in application servers, framework, libaries, databases, etc. not set to secure values,
                                - server does not send security headers/directives, or not set to secure values, 
                                - outdated or vulnerable software 
         - Preventive method - implement secure installation process, including
                                - automated, repeatable hardening process making it fast and easey to deploy another environment that is properly locked down. Different environments (Dev, QA, prod.) should be configured identically with different credetials used for each. 
                                - platform without unnecessary features, doc and sample. Remove / uninstall any unused features. 
                                - review and upadte the configurations, review cloud storage permissions. 
                                - segmented application architecture between components / tenants / groups 
                                - sending security directives to clients 
                                - having automated process to verify if the configuration and settings in all env. are effective. 
         - Examples
                        - s1 - application server with sample applications not removed from production servers. One of these application is the adm console with default password unchanged.
                        - s2 - directory listing is not disabled on the server. Attacker found, dowloaded the file, and later could be able to see the code and find flaw in the app. access control. 
                        - s3 - cloud service provider with default sharing permissions open to the Internet by other users. 
                       
                - A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components
                - A03:2021-Injection
        2. Any episode from Darknet Diaries.
        3. Pick a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), and briefly explain it & why it matters
### a) Sequel. Solve SQLZoo:
        0 SELECT basics
        2 SELECT from World, from first subtask to 5 "France, Germany, Italy"
### b) Injected. Solve WebGoat:
        A1 Injection (intro)
### m) Voluntary bonus: Pick your tasks from SQLZoo 1, 3-9.
### n) Voluntary difficult bonus: WebGoat: SQL Injection (advanced).
### o) Voluntary difficult bonus: Install a relational database, show CRUD operations using SQL
### q) Voluntary difficult bonus: Demonstrate aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT) with your own data you created in the previous step.
### p) Voluntary difficult bonus: Install a practice target for SQL injections, exploit it.
### r) Voluntary difficult bonus: Demonstrate JOIN with your own database
