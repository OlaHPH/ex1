<details><summary>x) Read and summarize - TBC (This subtask x does not require tests with a computer. Some bullets per article is enough for your summary, feel free to write more if you like)
        â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 10. Using Algorigthms: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 (from start until the start of "Dereferencing Keys" in 10.4)</summary>
<p>
        
The security of the whole system (data, communication, information, etc. security) is as strong as the weakest link, therefore every element (algorithm, protocol, key management, etc) has to be secure. 

Cryptography is only a very small part of the system - the mathematics of making the system secure. People sometimes focus only on its length while neglect the other aspects. Example: it's much easier to steal data from so's computer by breaking and installing a camera recording computer screen than cryptanalze the hard drive. 

Additionally, the "spy versus spy" cryptography technology is so obsolete as over 99% used in daily operations (bank cards, pay-TV, office building, computer access token, prepayment electricity meter, etc.). In these applications, cryptography role is minor. NSA (National Security Agency) admitted that most securities failures are not because of algorithms or protocol failures, but mainly due to other implementation failures (personel with harmful intention, faulty implementation, integration blunders, etc.) 
                    
*10.1 Choosing an algorithm

 Available options, all listed below have some issues, 
        * published algorithm (ground: as it's out there and already tested by the crytographer and survived) - most sensible option 
        * manufacturer (ground: they get to protect their reputation)
        * private consultant (ground: they know things)
        * the government (ground: the gov protects its citizen interest)
        * using their own algorithms (ground: the best, and self trust) 

 The algorithms in this book are public and listed with results, both positive and negative with exception of military cryptanalysis - no access. 
 
Algorithms for Export 
* must be approved by the US gov (or actually the NSA - National Security Agency). NSA gets a copy of the source code, but the algorithm's details stay in secret. 
* Non-official practices: 
  * leak a key bit once in a while, embedded in the ciphertext
  * fit the effective key within 30 bit range, example: while the algorithm may accept a 100-bit key, most of those keys might be equivalent (???) 
  * use a fix IV, or encrypt a fixed header at the beginning of each encrypted msg (known-plaintext attack)
  * generate few random bytes, encrypt them with the key, put both the plaintext and ciphertext of those random bytes at the beginning of the encrypted message (known-plaintext attack). 
        
             
*10.2 
        
*10.3
        
        
*10.4
* Note to self: 
        Although not required, I find reading chapter 1  Foundations, 1.1 Terminology provides a general overview and understanding of the most often used terminology in this book. From those: 
        plaintext (cleartext) - original message (M)
        encryption - the practice/act/process of disguise the msg to hide its subtance (E) vs decryption (D)
        ciphertext - encrypted message (C)
        cryptanalysis - art and science of breaking encrypted (ciphertext) message

* What treaths does it protect against?
* What information is encrypted, what's not?
* What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
* Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
* How is the data protected?
