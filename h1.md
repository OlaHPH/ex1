## h1x01 - Summary 1 on Intrusion Kill Chain and Courses of Action 
Ref. Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains,
### 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain 
Kill chain definition – a systematic process to target and engage a “victim” to obtain desired effects. According to the US Military, the process includes the following steps, known as F2T2EA
1.	Find the target 
2.	Fix the location
3.	Track and observe
4.	Target with suitable weapon/asset
5.	Engage the victim
6.	Assess effects 
The “chain” in the name implies the step-by-step nature of the process, as any failure in the sequence will interrupt the whole process. 
The NEW model – CNA Computer Network Attack and CNE Computer Network Espionage intrusion kill chain is developed based on this concept and has the following phases: 
1.	Reconnaissance (Observation) – research phase, collecting information (emails, social relationship, info on specific technologies) 
2.	Weaponization – create a weapon (trojan) into a deliverable payload, such as Adobe PDF or MS Office documents.
3.	Delivery – sending the payload to the targeted adversary, 3 most commonly used forms according to LM-CIRT in 2004-2010 are email attachments, websites and USB media. 
4.	Exploitation – triggering the code after delivery. Targets can be application or OS vulnerability, users themselves of OS feature leading to auto code execution. 
5.	Installation – installing remote access trojan/backdoor to maintain the existence of it at the victim environment.
6.	Command and Control (C2) – usually the hosts must signal outbound to Internet controller server to establish a C2 channel rather over manual interaction than automatic. Once done, the intruders gain “hands on the keyboard” access inside the target environment.  
7.	Actions on Objects – the intruders take action to achieve their original goals. Usually, it’s data extraction (collecting, encrypting and extracting info), violation data integrity or availability, or using it as a hop point before moving further into the network. 
### 3.3 Courses of Action 
Thorough understanding of intrusion kill chain model leads to the ability to build up measurement and decision to defend it. 
Defenders can also measure the performance and effectiveness of these actions as well as plan investment roadmaps to fix any existing gaps. 
Table 1: Courses of Action Matrix showcases the actions (Detect, Deny, Disrupt, Degrade, Deceive, Destroy) over corresponding phases of intrusion kill chain listed in 3.2. 
The Matrix implies the importance of completeness of the actions (“completeness equates to resiliency”) which is the main goal of the defender over time.
Concept “zero-day attacks” and “zero day protection” are introduced. 
Defender can “measure” its system resiliency by evaluating the performance and effectiveness of these actions as in fig.2 and based on that can have an overview or defending measures against intrusion attempts to locate the gaps and react accordingly. 

## h1x02 - Summary of command Line Basics Revisited as per Tero Karvinen
    Fast, convenient command lines used in Linux and BSD 

### Main categories 
 * Moving and looking around  - the ls and cd were my favorite as I got to use them a lot for the next assignment . bandit oh-five 
 * File manipulation
 * SSH remote control
 * Help
 * History and Guessing
 * Important directories 
 * Administrative commands 

## h1a - Bandit oh-five 
Over the Wire game level 0-4 completed  - easy tasks to get used to basic commmand lines 
The commands I used was
-ssh to get to the bandit[level]@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p2220
-ls - to list the files, ls -a to list all entries, including these starting with . 
-cd - to change directory up
-cat - concatenate files and print on the standard output
-find - with condition (-type f(file) -size (c is for byte!!!) ! -executable (not executable)
-to get out of a level and get to the next one - use exit (!!!) 
-also for level 2 - cat. "/spaces in this filename" worked the same way as cat ./spaces\ in\ this\ filename

## h1b - Bullseye 
Debian 11-Bullseye virtual machine in VirtualBox installation completed.
![bullseye](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99587532/214884972-5d4e533e-21f7-40dd-8a53-6849290e2948.png)
The issues I got into were: 
1. The installation live desktop was locked. Default credentials are "user", "live". (Thanks Tero) 
2. The black screen after booting the virtual machine. I tried the solution written by Tero in his article (Solve a Black Screen with xforcevesa (optional)) by adding xforcevesa and reboot but couldn't get through. The solution that worked for me was View (on top) -> Virtual Screen 1 -> Scale to 100% (unscaled output) and only after that I was able to see the login screen. 

## h1c - Webgoat
WebGoat practice target installation completed. The installation went smoothly using Tero's instruction at https://terokarvinen.com/2020/install-webgoat-web-pentest-practice-target/
 ![webgoat_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99587532/214888508-794c4ad3-c608-4602-b40f-109adaf27d78.png)
 To access Webwolf - I followed the instruction from [Youtube  how to install webwolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dff4SROag0w) - first got to https://owasp.org/www-project-webgoat/ and downloaded the webwolf-8.1.0.jar, opened it and ran the command (again, -ls and -cd to find the file and opened it in the terminator). 

## h1d - Hacker warmup - 
    - General: HTTP Basics - 
   I got into the network -> request to see the magic number. 
    - General: Developer tools -  very basic task follow since we've been using the Inspect tool and console for previous courses with html/css and java script. The only issue I got was copying the number (my mouse somehow behaved super weird and moved slowly so it took me quite a while to copy and paste the number).
    
## h1n - voluntary bonus
Banditry. Solve Over the Wire: Bandit 5-7 completed
<img width="860" alt="banditohfive_07" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99587532/215190532-a85689f9-51f5-4bb5-ab2c-08b7a33346b9.png">
## h1o - voluntary bonus, my fundaments. 
* What do you consider the fundamentals of security? 
    Keep things safe???
 
* What would you teach the first day? 
    Understand what security is, what data is, what the potential risk is and the vulnerability of data storage system, what would happen if the data is leaked/compromised, usual tactics, how data is handled in an unsafe and careless way on a daily basis, myths vs facts, how to study for this course and get the most out of it (for beginners like me - how to start from scratch and not lose hope). 

## h1p - voluntary bonus 
Johnny Tables. Solve Webgoat: A1 Injection (intro) - missing
## h1q - voluntary multi-week bonus, requires programming: 
Ptacek et al: Cryptopals - missing
