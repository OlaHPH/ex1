       <summary> 1. OWASP: OWASP 10 2021</summary>
a. A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration
       
* Overview - upranked from #6 to #5, part of the reason is the shift toward highly configurable softwares. Including CWE16 (Config.) and CWE611 (Improper Restriction of XML Extension Entity Reference).
       
* Description:
  * list of application features potentially increasing the application's vulnerability
  * missing proper security hardening accross any part of the app stack of improperly configured permissions on cloud services,
  * unnecessary featured enabled or installed (ports, pages, accounts, priviliges, etc.)
  * **default account setup enabled and unchanged**, 
  * error messages revealing too much,
  * latest security features disabled or not configured securely,
  * security setting in application servers, framework, libaries, databases, etc. not set to secure values,
  * server does not send security headers/directives, or not set to secure values, 
   * outdated or vulnerable software

                
* Preventive method - implement secure installation process, including
  * automated, repeatable hardening process making it fast and easey to deploy another environment that is properly locked down. Different environments (Dev, QA, prod.) should be configured identically with different credetials used for each. 
  * platform without unnecessary features, doc and sample. Remove / uninstall any unused features. 
  * review and upadte the configurations, review cloud storage permissions. 
  * segmented application architecture between components / tenants / groups 
  * sending security directives to clients 
  * having automated process to verify if the configuration and settings in all env. are effective. 

* Examples
  * s1 - application server with sample applications not removed from production servers. One of these application is the adm console with default password unchanged.
  * s2 - directory listing is not disabled on the server. Attacker found, dowloaded the file, and later could be able to see the code and find flaw in the app. access control. 
  * s3 - cloud service provider with default sharing permissions open to the Internet by other users. 
                       
b. A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components
        
* Overview - previously named Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities and ranked #2 in Top 10 community survey. This is the only cat. not having any CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposured) mapped to the included CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration). Including  CWE1104 - Use of Unmaintained 3rd party components. 

* Description - risks posed by
  * not knowing the version of all components whether directly or nested used (client-side/server-side),  
  * using vulnerable, unsupported, or outdated software (OS, web/app server, DBMS, app, APIs and all components, lib), 
  * not scanning regularly, not subcribing to security bulettins, 
  * not fixing or upgradingthe underlying platform, frameworks duly,
  * not testing the compatibility of updated, upgraded, or patched lib by SD, 
  * not securing the components' config. 
                            
* Preventive methods - having ongoing patch management process in place
  * removing unused features, files, doc, components
  * regularly conducting inventory of all versions of used components (client/server- sides) and their related tools, regularly checking official sources like CVE (Common Vul & Exp.) and NVD (Nat. Vul. Db) for vulnerabilities, use automated software analysis tools, subcribing to security email alerts 
  * getting components ONLY from official sources over secure links. 
  * checking unmaintained/older libs /components. Considering deploying virtual patch to check or protect against discovered issue. 
                                
* Example
  * accidental flaws (coding error) or intentional (backdoor) when running components
  * automated tools enabling locating unpatched/misconf. systems. 
                                
c. A03:2021-Injection             
        
* Overview - downranked from #2 to #3, with **more than 90%** application tested for some form of injection, including CWE79-Cross-side Scripting, CWE89 - **SQL Injection**, and 73 - Ext. Control of File Name of Path. Common injections include SQL, NoSQL, OS command, etc. 

* Description- risks are posed when 
  * data not validated, filtered or cleaned by the app,
  * dynamic queries with no escaping possibility are used directly
  *  "bad" data is used within OR (Object relational mapping) search param. to get extra, sensitive records. 
  * "bad" data is used or concat. directly     
                            
* Preventive methods
  * use a safe API with conditioned interface, avoid using the interpreter entirely
  * use positive server-side input validation (allowlist as in [Getting defensive with coding - Validating input](https://blog.securityinnovation.com/blog/2013/11/getting-defensive-with-coding-validating-input.html) - not a  complete measure for mobile app though
  * escape issue 
  * use LIMIT + other SQL controls to prevent mass records leak in case of SQL injection
              
<summary> 2. Ep 97 from Darknet Diaries: The Pizza Problem (https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/97/) </summary>

The episode told about Myles and his stressful experience when someone was trying to get his Instagram handle (OG - Original Gangster) persistently with several attemps like SIM swapping, calling him over, threatening him and his family (sending pizza to his address using his old phone number, other examples would be sending taxi, police, reporting a fire/gunfight and on). Even with with the tech background and the connections he had, he eventually gave up because of the pressure not only on him but his whole family - parents, children, partner, and on, and although he did file the case with the police, it was not taken seriously because the police or even the FBI haven't been trained for that. 

At the end of the episode, Nicole Beckwith was mentioned - she provides training, courses on this and her advice for the victims when being harassed, stalked was to go and file a complaint with the IC3 (Internet Crime Complaint Center) ran by the FBI or take it to the local FBI, or Secret Service.

* What did you learn? No matter how silly it may sound (an orginial, short, animal-name IG handle), each piece of your personal data is worthy and there are hackers out there who are willing to chase for it at all costs. They are persistent, they are brutal. Prepare for that despite how hard you try to protect it, you may as well lose the battle. 

* Threat actors: according to https://cyber.gc.ca/en/guidance/introduction-cyber-threat-environment, I would put the one (there are more than one, maybe a group from what implied in the podcast) from the podcast "Cybercriminals who are often financially motivated"

* Exploits - PIN swapping method as used in the beginning of podcast, his address, his name and his family data.
 
* Vulnerabilities - how his number to the SIM can be disconnected by someone calling to the phone service provider pretending to be him and change the number connected to his SIM card, then having access to his account (email,etc.) and get access on his personal data (banking, social media account), how the current system is not ready to handle such cases (lack of experience and skills, lack of understanding "but how it would affect the "victim", etc.) 
impact - loss of his private data, feeling insecure (not only for himself but for people around him) 

* How could defenders mitigate the attack better? - after this podcast, I really don't see how Myles could have done better in this case (he had the knowledge, he had the connections and experiences and still surrendered). The only thing I can see, probably in the hand of government, officials - they need to be trained to understand that it's a crime and how harmful it may be. 

* How could the attackers improve their attack? 
                
<summary> 3. Pick a CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), and briefly explain it & why it matters </summary>
CVE-2022-4720   - A "support user" account exists on the device and appears to be a backdoor for Technical Support staff. This account has a **default password and cannot be changed** by a user via **any normally accessible means.** .  In my understanding, it would fall under OWASP A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration as mentioned above with hardcoded/default credentials (default, unchanged). Solutiongiven by Tenable was to "apply the most recent vendor supplied patch". [Tenable - Synopsis] https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2022-37

        2 SELECT from World, from first subtask to 5 "France, Germany, Italy"
                1. Read the note about how, what kind of data stored in the table "world"
                
                2. Large countries - using WHERE with operators (>=) 

                3. Per capita GDP - 
                using division operator (/), AS to rename the column result to "per capita GDP" + applying condition with WHERE to filter the results.

<p>
### b) Injected. Solve WebGoat: 
        A1 Injection (intro)
        
        page 5. GRANT ALTER TABLE TO (all schemas as the task asked for "tables")  vs GRANT ALTER ON TABLE TO (one specific schema) - https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/317844/grant-alter-to-role-vs-grant-alter-on-schema
        
        page 9. the command shown here was quite confusing so at first it took me few times to get through (the right command line was shown under the result)  
         ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99587532/215704214-d8cde9d8-05a4-41e7-ac43-3aa19b5c5e1a.png)
         
        page 11. and the TAN - this one took me quite a while to figure out the solution. While searching, I found 2 approaches: 
        1. More often used - and for me also easier to understand (employee can be of any value while for the "Authentication TAN"- special attention needs to be paid to the syntax ...' OR '1' = '1
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99587532/215862392-21a8d0ef-e6e4-4c94-acc9-d624c7aab055.png)
        
        2.  From https://www.arbexam.blog/webgoat-sql-injection-intro/, here the "Authentication TAN" can be of any value, while for the "employee" field the input would look like a' OR '1' = '1'-- (as explained in the blog "– was important as it makes the rest of the query commented out" 
    See    -- Comment as explained by https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/comment-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16), 

        I would rather use the 1st approach as it's much visible for me.
        
        12. Update the salary  
        ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99587532/215867587-bb1614c8-72cb-4e58-8a13-434929d18b28.png)
        Quite similar to what was used for the previous task 
        as the task ask for updating the salary of JS so that it would be higher than Tobi (77000) and Bob (83700), I've modestly updated JS' salary to 85000. Hope he's now happy. 
        for Authentication TAN: Smith '; UPDATE employees SET salary = 85000 WHERE last_name='Smith
        for employee name - any value would work here. 
        
        13. Delete the log
        I used the DROP here and the ;
        '; DROP TABLE access_log --
        or 
        '; DROP TABLE access_log;--
       again the -- was used here to comment all that out. 
       
       These tasks are not very difficult but may be tricky to get through at first, especially with the ' location in the command.
