 The ATT&CK Matrix 
 
 Introduction to MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise with tactics and theirs specific techniques related with expansion to techniques specifications (ID,  procedure examples, mitigation, detection and on) makin ATT&CK a great resource for training, studying, planning and mapping. (Term used here - _"planning blue and red teaming exercises"_ a training strategy where the "red team" is the one trying to attack (TA) and the "blue team" is the one trying to defend.
